# ImGui Designer
ImGuiDesigner is a project aimed at simplifying the process of building user interfaces (UI) in C++ applications. The project provides an easy-to-use interface builder with interactive controls that allow users to create UIs using drag and drop, drag resizing, drag moving, and editing flags, colors, and styles. Furthermore, it generates C++ pseudo code that developers can use as a starting point for building their UIs.

Features:
The following are the key features of ImGuiDesigner:

User-friendly interface builder:
ImGuiDesigner provides a user-friendly interface builder that allows developers to create UIs using drag and drop. The interface builder also supports drag resizing, drag moving, and editing flags, colors, and styles.

C++ pseudo code generation:
ImGuiDesigner generates C++ pseudo code for the UI created using the interface builder. The generated code can be used as a starting point for building UIs in C++ applications.

Interactive controls:
ImGuiDesigner provides interactive controls that allow users to modify flags, colors, and styles of the UI components. This feature helps developers to customize the UI components according to their requirements.

Open-source:
ImGuiDesigner is an open-source project, which means that developers can contribute to the project and enhance its functionality.

Conclusion:
In summary, ImGuiDesigner is an easy-to-use interface builder that simplifies the process of building UIs in C++ applications. Its interactive controls, C++ pseudo code generation, and multi-platform support make it a useful tool for developers. Furthermore, being open-source allows developers to contribute to the project and make it even better.
